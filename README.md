# qr-code-generator
 
## Description

I'm sitting in the Bluebonnet Room at the UTA CSE 50 year computing celebration, and a prospective student may be interested in MOBI. A QR code would be the easiest way to show them our website.

Rather than paying for a QR code from somewhere like Bitly, and then having access lost or the link broken, I decided to make one for MOBI on GitHub, where hopefully it will be available for a long time.

## Usage
Run the script with `python3 qr.py` and it will generate a QR code for the URL in the script. 

You can change the URL to whatever you want, and it will generate a new QR code.
