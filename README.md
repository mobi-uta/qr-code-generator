^QR code made with this script

## Description

I'm sitting in the Bluebonnet Room at the UTA CSE 50 year computing celebration, and a prospective student may be interested in MOBI. A QR code would be the easiest way to show them our website.

Rather than paying for a QR code from somewhere like Bitly, and then having access lost or the link broken, I figured a QR code generator on our GitHub will be more persistent.

## Usage
Run the script with   

`python3 qr.py`   

and it will generate a QR code for the URL in the script. 

You can change the URL to whatever you want, and it will generate a new QR code.
